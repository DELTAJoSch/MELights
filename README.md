# MELights
##What is MELights?
MELights is (going) to be a control software for model railway lighting systems.
MELights will control an [Arduino Mega](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoMega2560) via a serial connection. This serial connection will send and recieve information about pins, controlled via a easy-ro-use GUI. MELights is created using [QT](www.qt.io).

##Install MELights
As there is (as of yet) no finished project, there is nothing to be installed.
